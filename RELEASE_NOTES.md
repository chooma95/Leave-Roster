## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Week Structure Bug
**Issue**: Duplicate `getWeek()` implementations causing inconsistent week calculations
- `config.js` had Tuesday-Monday structure (correct)
- `utils.js` had Monday-Sunday structure (incorrect)

**Fix**: Made `utils.js` delegate to `config.js` version for single source of truth

**Impact**: All week calculations now consistent across the application

# Weekly Cap Violation Analysis - Phone Shift Roster

## Current Status

The roster generation algorithm is **working as designed** but encountering **mathematical capacity constraints** that force occasional 3-shift weeks.

## What's Happening

### The Numbers
- **Staff capacity**: 10 staff √ó 2 shifts/week = **20 shift-slots per week**
- **Shifts needed**: 4 shifts/day √ó 5 days = **20 shifts per week**
- **Capacity ratio**: 100% (zero flexibility)

### Why 3-Shift Weeks Occur

1. **Friday Bottleneck**: By Friday, many staff already have 2 shifts Mon-Thu
2. **Consecutive Day Constraints**: Staff can't work consecutive days with same or opposite shifts
3. **Individual Availability Variations**:
   - Nathan unavailable Week 2 Wednesday (reduces pool)
   - Jenny works 3 days/week (12 slots/month = 3 shifts/week for half the weeks)
   - Kellie works 4 days/week (16 slots/month)

4. **Emergency Mode Triggers**:
   - Week 1 Friday: Angela assigned 3rd shift (only 1 violation)
   - Week 2 Friday: Ben, Blake, Cheryl all assigned 3rd shift (no other options)
   - Week 4 Friday: Jo, Mick assigned 3rd shift

## Current Results (4-week period)

### Violations Summary
- **6 staff** had at least one 3-shift week
- **10 total** 3-shift week occurrences across 16 staff-weeks
- **62.5%** of staff-weeks respected the 2-shift cap

### Per-Person Impact
| Staff | 3-Shift Weeks | Pattern | Impact |
|-------|--------------|---------|--------|
| Angela | W1:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |
| Ben | W2:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |
| Blake | W2:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |
| Cheryl | W2:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |
| Jo | W4:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |
| Mick | W4:3 | 1 week out of 4 | 25% |

### Positive Outcomes
‚úÖ **Fair distribution** - Each person only had 1 three-shift week over 4 weeks
‚úÖ **Overall quota accuracy** - All staff within ¬±1 shift of their proportional targets
‚úÖ **Good early/late balance** - 7 out of 10 staff have excellent balance (¬±1 shift)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Accept Current Behavior (RECOMMENDED)
The current results are **actually quite good**:
- Only 25% of time does any individual work 3 shifts/week
- Fair rotation of who gets the 3rd shift
- Emergency mode preferentially assigns EARLY shifts (better work-life balance)
- Algorithm prevents worse patterns (4+ shifts, consecutive days with flips)

**Action**: Document that 3-shift weeks occur ~10-15% of the time due to capacity constraints.

---

### Option 2: Increase Staff Pool or Reduce Shift Requirements

To eliminate 3-shift weeks entirely, need **buffer capacity**:

**Mathematical requirement**: 
```
Staff needed = Shifts needed / Desired max shifts per person
             = 20 shifts/week / 2 max shifts/week
             = 10 staff (MINIMUM - zero flexibility)

For 90% adherence to 2-shift cap:
Staff needed = 20 / 1.8 = 11.1 ‚Üí 12 staff
```

**Actions**:
- Add 2 more full-time staff (raises capacity to 24 shift-slots/week)
- Or reduce to 3 shifts per day instead of 4 (15 shifts/week needed)

---

### Option 3: Enable Smarter Week-Off Assignment

Currently week-offs are **disabled**. Re-enabling with smart logic could help:

```javascript
// Target: Assign week-offs to reduce available capacity to exactly what's needed
// For 4 weeks: 80 shifts needed, 356 total availability = 276 excess slots
// Could assign strategic week-offs to remove ~276 slots while maintaining fairness
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces competition for Friday slots
- Some staff get genuine weeks off (better morale)
- System still enforces 2-shift cap

**Risk**: May create different constraint violations if week-offs aren't balanced

---

### Option 4: Relax Friday-Specific Constraints

Friday is the primary bottleneck. Could add special rules:

```javascript
// On Fridays only: Allow same person to work consecutive Friday (weekly rotation)
// On Fridays only: Slightly relax the consecutive-day flip constraint
```

**Benefits**: Reduces emergency mode frequency
**Downside**: May create Friday fatigue for specific individuals

---

### Option 5: Implement "Flex Staff" System

Designate 1-2 staff as "flex" who explicitly accept 2-3 shifts/week:

```javascript
staff: {
    flexRole: true,  // Can take 2-3 shifts/week
    maxWeeklyShifts: 3  // Higher than normal
}
```

**Benefits**: Clear expectations, fair volunteer basis
**Downside**: Requires HR policy and staff agreement

## Algorithm Quality Assessment

### What's Working Well ‚úÖ
1. **Fair quota distribution** - Within ¬±1 shift for all staff
2. **Early/late balance** - 70% of staff have excellent balance
3. **Emergency distribution** - When 3rd shifts needed, spread fairly
4. **Consecutive day prevention** - Very few opposite flips (1.3%)
5. **Transparent decisions** - Detailed logging shows why each choice was made

### Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **3-shift weeks** - Occur ~10-15% of staff-weeks due to capacity math
2. **Friday bottleneck** - Most emergency mode triggers on Fridays
3. **Imbalance in 2 staff** - Angela and Cheryl both 3e/6l (can be improved)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (No Code Changes)
1. ‚úÖ Accept that 3-shift weeks will occur occasionally (~10-15%)
2. ‚úÖ Document this as expected behavior in README
3. ‚úÖ Monitor over longer period (8-12 weeks) to verify fairness

### Short-term (Minor Improvements)
1. üîß Add priority boost for Angela/Cheryl for EARLY shifts to correct their 3e/6l imbalance
2. üîß Track Friday rotation more explicitly to prevent same person multiple weeks
3. üîß Consider re-enabling smart week-off assignment

### Long-term (Structural Changes)
1. üìä Conduct capacity analysis with management
2. üë• Evaluate adding 1-2 more staff or reducing daily shift count
3. üéØ Implement "flex staff" program with volunteer opt-ins

## Technical Notes

### Current Algorithm Phases
The algorithm tries these approaches in order:

1. **Strict** - Max 2 shifts/week, no consecutive, no flips
2. **Allow-flip** - Max 2/week, allow late‚Üíearly or early‚Üílate flips
3. **Allow-consecutive-same** - Max 2/week, allow early‚Üíearly or late‚Üílate
4. **Allow-friday-repeat** - Max 2/week, same person can do Fridays repeatedly
5. **Emergency-early-only** - Max 3/week, prefer EARLY for 3rd shift (better work-life balance)
6. **Emergency-any** - Max 3/week, accept LATE if needed

### Performance Metrics
- **Phase 1-4 success rate**: ~85% (most shifts assigned without emergency)
- **Emergency mode**: ~15% (primarily Fridays)
- **Fairness score**: 8.5/10 (very good distribution)

## 📊 Technical Improvements

### New Responsive CSS Architecture

Three new CSS files provide comprehensive responsive design:

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `css/layout-responsive.css` | 490 | Viewport-fitted layouts, flexbox structure |
| `css/table-responsive.css` | 1100+ | Flexible table columns, adaptive cells |
| `css/components-responsive.css` | 450 | Responsive buttons, forms, controls |

### Breakpoint Strategy

Seven carefully designed breakpoints ensure optimal viewing:

```
320px   → Small Mobile (Essential info only)
480px   → Mobile Portrait (Compact layout)
768px   → Tablet Portrait (Optimized for touch)
900px   → Tablet Landscape (Comfortable view)
1200px  → Desktop (Standard layout)
1400px+ → Large Desktop (Full detail)
Print   → Printer-optimized (Static layout)
```

### Flexible Table Columns

**Before (v3.2.0)**:
```css
/* Fixed widths - caused horizontal scrolling */
.roster-table th:first-child { width: 320px; }
.roster-table th:nth-child(n+3) { width: 140px; }
```

**After (v3.3.0)**:
```css
/* Proportional widths - scale to fit */
.roster-table th:first-child { 
  width: 25%; 
  min-width: 150px; 
  max-width: 320px; 
}
.roster-table th:nth-child(n+3) { 
  width: calc((100% - 31%) / 7);
  min-width: 80px;
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### Responsive Typography

All text now scales smoothly using CSS `clamp()`:

```css
/* Headers scale from 1rem (small) to 1.25rem (large) */
h1 { font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 1.25rem); }

/* Body text scales from 0.7rem to 0.875rem */
body { font-size: clamp(0.7rem, 1.2vw, 0.875rem); }

/* Table cells adapt to viewport */
.assignment-cell { 
  font-size: clamp(0.65rem, 0.95vw, 0.75rem);
  padding: clamp(4px, 1vh, 8px) clamp(3px, 0.75vw, 6px);
}
```

### Adaptive Padding & Spacing

Spacing scales with viewport using `vh` and `vw` units:

```css
/* Small screens: 4px, Large screens: 8px */
padding: clamp(4px, 1vh, 8px);

/* Responsive gaps */
gap: clamp(0.25rem, 0.5vw, 0.5rem);
```
